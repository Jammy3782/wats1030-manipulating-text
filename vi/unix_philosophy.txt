x Philosophy
From The Unix Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike
Even Though the Unix system introduces a number of innovated programs and techni
ques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effec
tive is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Althoug
h that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is th
e idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among progra
ms than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things
Â in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tool
s.
